## Challenges

### Getting Suggested Gas Prices

For mainnet it was easy to get suggested gas prices by utilising Etherscan's [Gas Tracker](https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/gas-tracker) API. But it's not supported for Goerli.

So, I had to make a makeshift gas tracker by analysing previous Block's Txns
To make it organised, I made a serverless function that returns the suggested Gas prices for Mainnet and Goerli.
